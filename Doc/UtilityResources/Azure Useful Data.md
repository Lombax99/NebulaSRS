All VM created share the same setting, they can all be reached via ssh with the following credential:
- User: student
- Pass: Microsoft_Merda

Via NetworkSecurityGroup i've defined rules to block the VM from the laptop subdomain to reach the VM in server subdomain and viceversa. All can reach the lighthouse.
