  <h1>Nebula Remote Access Tool</h1>
  
Application to implement an assistant tool for management of a [Nebula](https://github.com/slackhq/nebula) network <b>cloud based</b>. The project had been developed for the course of [Scalable and Reliable Services M](https://www.unibo.it/it/studiare/dottorati-master-specializzazioni-e-altra-formazione/insegnamenti/insegnamento/2023/472686) of the University of Bologna.

Nebula is a zero-trust overlay networking tool designed to be fast, secure, and scalable. Connect any number of hosts with on-demand, encrypted tunnels that work across any IP network and without opening firewall ports.  </br>
The project’s goal is to implement a web application to allow one or more admins of a Nebula network to access assigned machines through Nebula itself. The project’s main focus is to use Nebula-generated certificates to bypass firewall configurations of the nodes. For this reason, security will be a top priority in managing permissions, roles, and certificate emissions. We will leverage the power of Azure cloud services to host the web app and the database. 
</br></div>

<div align="center"> 
The project does not focus on Nebula host configuration or certificate management. We will assume to work with a correctly pre-configured network.</br>
CI/CD has been achieved using Azure combined with Github Actions while Terraform has been used to implement infrastructure as a code.
